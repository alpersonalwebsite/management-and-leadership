# ITIL 4


## To remember or recall...

Service Management is HOW an organization generates value through its services to its customers (stakeholders)

### Value
> Is the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something.

* Providers and consumers co-create value.
* Value is subjective. For example, if we take the case of 2 people studying Agile... One can be doing it just to obtain the certification, the other with the aim of learn and improve her work.

### Organization
> Is a person or group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities and relationships to achieve its objectives. 

* Different size and complexity.
* Various legal entities.
* Can be one person or a whole Company.

### Service Providers

An organization that provides services. Can be internal (like the own company's Help Desk) or external (like AWS)
