# Management and Leadership

Slowly (probably slower than I'd like), I will be adding personal notes linked to my `Leadership and Managerial experience`, and, among these, some basic knowledge relative to `IT Management`

## Becoming a Manager

Unlike other people, I don’t have (or, at least I don’t remember) a precise date in which I developed into a Manager. However, what I do recall is that in every project, no matter its size or type, I always tried to keep a plural (multidimensional or holistic) sight. As an ex IC Software Developer, this pushed me to do more than “just coding”. Let’s go back in time...!

I discovered programming through chat-rooms... Particularly, `AOL` halls.
I was a fresh and introverted kid with some MS-DOS experience, not really excited about the IT promise, until... The first of countless `AOL’s CDs` arrived in my mail. I think (excuse my poor memory) I’m reliving 1997. If you "grew up" in the 90's... You definitely will remember AOL's invasion!  

Living in South America, having access to “The Web” was not easy; prices were extremely high and... We, the kids, didn’t have a way to justify Internet’s usage nor blocking the telephone line for hours. However, after several tradeoffs with my father, I received the approval to try "AOL's internet" for one hour. 
Great! I put the cd in the reader, install AOL software, but... My old pc didn’t have a modem. Houston, we have a problem!

In those days my knowledge was quite limited (it’s not like I’m Mr. Miyagi now, yet I can defend myself). 

What I was going to do? 

Surely, not waste my well-earned 60 minutes of pure Internet. I went back to my father and tried to explain why WE needed a new pc. I ensured that having a new computer was going to improve my performance at school, and also, it would let me help him balancing our finances beyond papers. As you can imagine, the last pledge was never fulfilled.
