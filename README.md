# Management and Leadership

Slowly, I will be adding personal notes linked to my Leadership and Managerial experience, and, among these, some basic knowledge relative to IT Management.

## Becoming a Manager

Unlike other people, I don’t have (or, at least I don’t remember) a precise date in which I developed into a Manager. However, what I do recall is that in every project, no matter its size or type, I always tried to keep a plural (multidimensional) sight. As an ex-plain IC Software Developer, this pushed me to do more than “just coding”. Let’s go back in time...!

I discovered programming through chatrooms... Particularly, AOL halls.
I was a fresh and introverted kid with some MS-DOS experience, not really excited about the IT promise, until... The first of countless cds arrived in my mail. I think (excuse my poor memory) I’m reliving 1997.
