# Management and Leadership

Slowly, I will be adding personal notes linked to my Leadership and Managerial experience, and, among these, some basic knowledge relative to IT Management.

## Becoming a Manager

Unlike other people, I don’t have (or, at least I don’t remember) a precise date in which I developed into a Manager. However, what I do recall is that in every project, no matter its size or type, I always tried to keep a plural (multidimensional) sight. As an ex-plain IC Software Developer, this pushed me to do more than “just coding”. Let’s go back in time...!

I discovered programming through chatrooms... Particularly, AOL halls.
I was a fresh and introverted kid with some MS-DOS experience, not really excited about the IT promise, until... The first of countless AOL’s CDs arrived in my mail. I think (excuse my poor memory) I’m reliving 1997. 

Living in South America, having access to “The Web” was not easy; prices were extremely expensive and... We, the kids, didn’t have a way to justify Internet’s usage nor blocking the telephone line for hours. However, after several tradeoffs with my father, I received the approval to try it for one hour. Great! I put the cd in the reader, install AOL software, but... My old pc didn’t have a modem. Houston, we have a problem!

In those days my knowledge was quite limited (it’s not like I’m a Mr. Miyagi now, yet I can defend myself). What I was going to do? Surely, not waste my well-earned 60 minutes of pure Internet. I went back to my father and tried to explain why WE needed a new pc. I ensured that having a new computer was going to improve my performance at school, and also, it will let me help him balancing our finances beyond papers. As you can imagine, the last pledge was never fulfilled.
